# ms_cognition_97


This repository provide access to the annotation files and look up tables (LUT) describing the association between an extensive battery of 23 cognitive tests and cortical thickness in 97 persons with Multiple Sclerosis. Besides a combination over all tests, the repository contains domain specific (attention/information processing, memory, spatial processing, executive functioning) and task-specific associations with regional cortical thickness.
